* Utilized Java servlets to implement RESTful web services (HTTP requests and responses)
* Built relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB) to store data captured from [TicketMaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/)
* Deployed server to [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) to handle 150 queries per second tested by [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/)
* Used ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze user behavior in terms of demographics, location, and service provider to provide better recommendations
